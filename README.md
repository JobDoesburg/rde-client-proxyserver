# RDE client proxy server
This repository contains the RDE client proxy server. The sole purpose of this proxy server is to enable communication 
between the RDE JS client, running in the browser, and the RDE app running on a phone. The proxy server is a simple
HTTP server that can open up WebSocket connections for a specific token. The server will function as a echo server for 
all WebSocket connections. 

This server is not meant to be used in production currently. It is a proof-of-concept implementation that is meant to
demonstrate the feasibility of the RDE prototype. In production, the endpoint to create a new token for opening 
WebSocket connections should be authenticated. Also, inactive sockets should be closed after a certain amount of time,
and the server should make sure the correct protocol is used over the sockets.

## Security considerations
The sole purpose of this server is to enable communication between the RDE JS client and the RDE app. The server does 
**not** store data or process any data in an unencrypted form. However, under the current [decryption handshake
protocol](https://gitlab.surf.nl/filesender/rde-js-client/-/blob/main/src/decryption/handshake-protocol.md),
an active MITM attack on the proxy server could allow an attacker to get access to the retrieved key. This is because
there is no further confirmation that the browser and app are using the same shared secret. This is a known issue and 
should be addressed in the future, but is not a priority at the moment. It can easily be resolved by adding a `linking 
code` to the handshake protocol. This linking code can be generated by the app and manually be entered by the user in 
the browser, and used to construct the shared secret. This way, even if an active MITM attack is performed, the attacker
will not get access to the decryption parameters (which are not secret) and the recovered key (which is secret).
